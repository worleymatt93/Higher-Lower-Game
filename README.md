# Higher-Lower-Game

A simple Python command-line interface game where you guess which public figure has more followers. Inspired by the classis "Higher or Lower" concept.

# How to Play

1. Two random profiles are displayed.
2. Each profile includes:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Country
3. You guess which profile has more followers by typing *A* or *B*.
4. If you guess correctly, your score inscreases and the game continues.
5. The game ends when you make an incorrect guess.
